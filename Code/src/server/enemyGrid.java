/**
 * This class inherits from the super class "Grid".
 * This class lets us create a grid that is representing the opponent's grid 
 * in which the player will be shooting and observing his potential hits or misses.
 * 
 * Each grid cell will by default be populate with an integer equal to 0.
 * When the player shoots in the grid, 2 outcomes are possible:
 * hit -> cell value is set to 1
 * no hit -> cell value is set to -1 
 * 
 * A cell value can therefor have 3 values :
 * 0  -> not shot yet  
 * 1  -> shot & hit
 * -1 -> shot but no hit
