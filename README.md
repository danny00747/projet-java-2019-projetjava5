# Battleground 

Battleground is a 2 player arcade game based on the popular [Battleship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battleship_(game)) board game. 

Instead of a sea with ships, you play on the ground with buildigns and vehicles.<br>
Each player has :
#### 3 buildings:
1. Airport
2. Radar tower
3. Headquarter

#### 3 vehicles:
1. Gustav railway gun
2. MMRL (Mobile Multiple Rocket Launcher)
3. Tank 

In addition to the normal rules where a player can only shoot and hit one cell of the grid at a time, we added some special actions such as:

* an airstrike (drops bombs on 7 cells horizontally or vertically)
* a radar (discovers 4 cells)
* a rocket strike (shoots 4 rockets randomly in a 7 by 7 cells area)
* ... 

Each one of these special actions can only be used if the linked building or vehicle isn't destroyed and they have a "reload-time" to keep the game dynamic and strategically.
